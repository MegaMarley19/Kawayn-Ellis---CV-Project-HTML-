    <p>One of my favourite hobbies is weightlifting. I have beeen doing this for roughly 6 years and stil make time for the gym every day before I go to work. I often go with friends as group sessions tend to be more enjoyable and you can push each other to hit new targets.</p>

    <p>Another one of my hobbies is photography. Although I haven't taken many photographs as of recently, from time to time I still love to stroll down to the local park and capture images of the beautiful scenery and wildlife.</p>
